Dense NN_Adenosine A3.txt is a python script that utilizes a densely connected neural network to describe the binding affinity (Ki - nM) between target molecules and the Adenosine A3 receptor. Binding affinity was categorized as 'strong' (Ki of 0 to 10), 'intermediate' (Ki of 10 to 1000), and 'weak' (Ki of >1000). Target molecules and binding affinity data was sourced from BindingDB. The accuracy of this model on test and validation sets was ~80% for each set.
